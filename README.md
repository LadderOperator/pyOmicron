# pyOmicron
Python Script to read and parse Omicron Matrix file format.

This file can parse the parameters of Omicron matrix files.
Thanks to the source code of Gwyddion this python script was easy to implement
http://gwyddion.sourcearchive.com/documentation/2.16/omicronmatrix_8c-source.html

The main goal in to be able to read and plot spectroscopy files and mainly I(V)_mtrx files.
Images can be read perfectly with Gwyddion and they will be implemented only in a future release.
